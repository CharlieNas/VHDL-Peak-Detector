# VHDL Peak Detector

A VHDL-based system for detecting and storing peak values, synthesised on an Artix-7 FPGA.

## Project Overview

* **Objective**: Design, implement, and test a peak detector system in VHDL, passing simulation test benches and synthesising correctly on an FPGA.
* **Components**:
  * **Data Processor**: Identifies and stores peak values within a stream of data.
  * **Command Processor**: Manages communication and data transfer between the FPGA and external systems.
* **Applications**:
  * High-speed communication systems
  * Satellite data processing

## Features

* **Peak Detection Algorithm**: Detects and stores peak values in a data sequence using an efficient state machine.
* **State Machine Architecture**: Ensures proper synchronisation and processing flow for accurate peak detection.
* **FPGA Synthesis**:
  * Successfully synthesised on an Artix-7 FPGA.
  * Resolved synthesis issues by eliminating inferred latches.

## System Architecture
